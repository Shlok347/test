<b><i><a name="3images in html"><h2>Direct Memory Access (DMA)</h2></a> is one of several methods for coordinating the timing of
data transfers between an input/output (I/O) device and the core processing unit or
memory in a computer.<br> DMA is one of the faster types of synchronization mechanisms,
generally providing significant improvement over interrupts, in terms of both latency and
throughput. An I/O device often operates at a much slower speed than the core.1 DMA
allows the I/O device to access the memory directly, without using the core. </b></i><br><br><hr>

most common operations performed in processing applications. There are several
advantages of using DMA, rather than the core, in the DSP56300 family: <br>DMA saves core MIPS because the core can operate in parallel.
DMA saves power because it requires less circuitry than the core to move data.
DMA saves pointers because core AGU pointer registers are not needed.
DMA has no modulo block size<br>
